## v0.1.1
*12 Sep 2024*
Issue solved.


## v0.1.0
*11 Sep 2024*
#### Aixt V language
Now Aixt V is closer to original V due to:
- All the variables are immutable by default. The `mut` reserved word is fully supported.
- Only a few C pre-processor directives are supported (#include)
- C macros are avoided
- The Aixt API is implemented mainly in V
- Reference variables are supported
- Interoperability with C is improved by allowing the calling of C functions, constants and variables by using the syntax: `C.function()` or `C.identifier`, previous including the correspondent C header file
- declaration/initialization by function calling directly
##### Changes:
- The pin names and modes donÂ´t include the module's name so `pin.setup(pin.d5, pin.output)` changes to `pin.high(d5, output)`, this change is for been less redundant.
- All the variables are immutable by default. If a mutable variable is needed, the use of mut reserved word is imperative.
- Variables can be declared/initialized by calling a function directly, so this two lines: `a := u16(0)` `a = adc.read(an5)` can be replaced by: `a := adc.read(an5)`
#### API standardization
(v0.1.0)
The function names were standardized for these modules:
- `pin`: individual pins
- `port`: pin ports
- `adc`: analog to digital converter
- `pwm`: pulse width modulation
- `uart`: serial port
- `time`: delaying functions
#### Configuration `.toml` files
Now the configuration files are split by device-settings and compiler-settings in different `.toml` files, in order to reuse and make it easy to include similar devices.
#### Supported devices
##### Emulator
Software emulator on Linux, Android (Termux) and Windows (x64-based or AArch64-based device: x64 or AArch64), using GCC or TCC compilers.
