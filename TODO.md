# Aixt TODO

Tasks to do in Aixt


### Todo

- [ ] Implement variable swapping (by using temporal vars) #feat
- [ ] dynamic memory definition
- [ ] Implement inline assembly
- [ ] "40_inline_asm.v" inline asm implementation
- [ ] Implement uart.input()
- [ ] Support for arrays and strings initialized inside "for" statement
- [ ] Issue: Ident names including module and function name or scope position (for all ports)
- [ ] Implement `lock` and `rlock` keywords (initially for NXT port)
- [ ] Implement an equivalent to Arduino's `millis()`
- [ ] Implements sub-modules
- [ ] Implement CH32V and CH5xx families on Arduino through PlatformIO
- [ ] Add a configuration file inside each project folder in order to make it easy to integrate Aixt to and IDE like PlatformIO


### In Progress

- [ ] generates documentation from code
- [ ] Implement structs #feat
    - [ ] support struct fields (`struct_name.struct_field`)
- [ ] implement maps
- [ ] Change arrays to pure V
- [ ] Start a vscode extension for Aixt
- [ ] Give support to reference and dereference
- [ ] Implement float formatting on string interpolations (`${x:.2}`)
- [ ] Issue: Calling function from array interpolations
- [ ] Issue: can not import a module from another module
- [ ] Standardize the member vars `api_mod_paths` and `api_lib_paths` as maps
